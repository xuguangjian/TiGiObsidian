Hi Everyone, I have some great news! I am a PhD candidate in the study of religion of the ancient Mediterranean world, integrating other disciplines like sociology, anthropology, ethnography, etc. I used Obsidian for a brand new research project that turned into a full-length article publication at the top journal of my field! It took me only 3 months from start to finish thanks to Obsidian (most research articles take about 2 years in my field). I'm seriously debating if I should include Obsidian in my acknowledgements lol

Certainly! If you would like more information, then just let me know. Here is a rough outline on how Obsidian made the process much more efficient and effective:
1. I began with a brand new topic to which I had very little exposure
2. I created a provisional bibliography that grew in # of sources as well as organization/themes. Each entry was a backlink that I would fill out as I go
3. My project/paper is very interdisciplinary (e.g., sociolinguistics, ritual theory, anthropology, neuroscience, ethology, sociology, religious studies, classics, ancient history), so being able to find recurring themes/ideas in a cogent way was very critical. I'd be sure make backlinks and quick notes so that I could write about these interactions later. This made my research standout as I wasn't just repeating scholarly debates, but I was adding a new perspective/assessment on existing debates.
4. Although Obsidian was very helpful, I still had to put in the work! Nothing replaces good reading/notetaking, and critical/creative thinking
5. Obsidian tags, highlights, backlinks, and blockquotes were the most instrumental. 
6. With tags, it wasn't so much the search feature, but the ability to quickly see them as I would review my notes. So tags, highlights, and blockquotes were easy way for me to review the salient points of my notes
7. With backlinks, they were useful as I mentioned for the working bibliography. But also I could create notes on certain thoughts that I think would serve as key premises for my argument. I'd create them as a backlink and fill that note as I would progressively do my research

Now onto the draft/writing phase. All of the key ideas were there in my notes, so it was just a matter of referencing them via backlinks. Essentially, I'd create an outline where each section was a list of key ideas and backlinks. Then writing each section in my own words was easier because I knew both the main idea and the key sources for my argument.
Now onto the revision process. I would granularize and enumerate each comment from the reviewers. With each comment, I would make a list of backlinks (both existing of future ones) to address each comment. At this point, Obsidian had rolled out block references, which made this even easier!

中文粗略翻译：
大家好，我有个好消息!我是一名研究古地中海世界宗教的博士研究生，整合了社会学、人类学、民族志等其他学科。我用黑曜石做了一个全新的研究项目，并在我的领域的顶级期刊上发表了一篇完整的文章!多亏了黑曜石，我从开始到完成只花了3个月的时间(在我的领域里，大多数研究论文都要花2年时间)。我在认真考虑我是否应该在我的致谢中加入黑曜石，哈哈

当然!如果你想知道更多的信息，请告诉我。以下是黑曜石如何使这一过程更加高效和有效的大致轮廓:
1. 我开始了一个全新的话题，我很少接触到这个话题
2. 我创建了一个临时的参考书目，在资源和组织/主题方面都有增长。每一项都是一个反向链接，我将填写我走
3.我的课题/论文是跨学科的(例如，社会语言学、仪式理论、人类学、神经科学、动物行为学、社会学、宗教研究、经典著作、古代史)，所以能够以一种令人信服的方式找到重复出现的主题/思想是非常关键的。我一定会做反向链接和快速笔记，这样我以后就可以写下这些互动。这使得我的研究脱颖而出，因为我不仅仅是在重复学术辩论，而是在现有辩论中增加了一个新的视角/评估。
4. 虽然黑曜石很有用，但我还是要投入工作!没有什么能取代好的阅读/记笔记，批判性/创造性思维
5. 黑曜石标签、高亮显示、反向链接和blockquotes是最常用的工具。
6. 使用标签，与其说是搜索功能，不如说是快速查看它们的能力，就像我复习笔记一样。因此，标记、高亮和blockquotes是我复习笔记要点的简单方法。
7. 有了反向链接，它们对工作参考书目很有用。但我也可以对某些想法做笔记，我认为这些想法可以作为我的论点的关键前提。我会创建他们作为一个反向链接，并填写笔记，因为我将逐步做我的研究
现在进入草稿/写作阶段。所有的关键思想都在我的笔记里，所以这只是通过反向链接引用它们的问题。本质上，我会创建一个大纲，其中每个部分都是一个关键思想和反向链接的列表。然后用我自己的话写每个部分就容易多了，因为我知道我的论点的主要思想和关键来源。
现在进入修订过程。我将把评论家们的每一条评论一一罗列出来。对于每个评论，我将制作一个反向链接列表(现有的和将来的)来处理每个评论。在这一点上，Obsidian已经推出了块引用，这使这更容易!/emm
